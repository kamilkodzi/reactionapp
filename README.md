Excellent work on completing this section - and this course, for that matter! With this project done, you’ve now completed the React hooks journey of this course. Let’s do a quick review of the main lessons from this section:

UseReducer - this hooks allows you to apply the reducer pattern to your application and components. With a reducer, you call pull out your state data into one centralized object for the entire app. Based on dispatching action objects to the reducer, it will collect data and adapt the application state over time.

UseContext - with this hook, you can apply a React context object to a tree of React components. The nested components in that tree will have the ability to reference shared objects and data contained in that context object.

Pub/Sub - the publish/subscribe software pattern allows you to set up a network based on channels. Publishers send messages across those channels. And subscribers pick up those messages.

Overall, I hope you’ve enjoyed this journey through React hooks. It’s the most exciting update to React since its inception. It’s also still so early in its inception - so many of the best practices and patterns are still being formalized. So in a sense, by taking this course, you’re become a pioneer of sorts in the React hooks domain!

Ok, next, there are some final remarks to conclude and bonus content in the next section. So be sure to check those to officially complete the course!
